This application provides offline capabilities for translation, paraphrasing, and grammatical error correction, supporting up to 5,000 words. The goal was to cover multiple academic domains such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, law, political science, and medicine. Other disciplines were not included, and even within the mentioned fields, specialized translation may be inaccurate due to limited domain-specific vocabulary. However, general terms are translated correctly. 
Iâ€™ve made this available so that enthusiasts can improve it, expand its features, add domain-specific vocabulary, and refine the application's interface and visuals. Commercial use of this program is strictly prohibited.
This program was developed with the assistance of Copilot AI. Commercial usage rights are reserved for the Alleh team, led by Ahmad Rouhi Meleh, and those who contributed to this project. I am a PhD student in theoretical physics, gradually and steadily learning programming with support from artificial intelligence.
